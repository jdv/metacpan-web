# Missing module ? - why can I not find a specific module?

## Is it in the index?

MetaCPAN uses the [PAUSE](http://pause.perl.org/) generated
[p6dists.json.gz](https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/p6dists.json.gz)
file. If it's not in there, then the module author will need to fix this.
(Authors are usually emailed about this when they upload a distribution).

## Is the distribution POD only with no package?

A distribution must contain a package, even if it is 100% POD.
Check
the package declaration in the source of this file.  That's the key to getting
your pure POD distribution indexed by PAUSE.
